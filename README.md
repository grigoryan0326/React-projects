# React-projects

This repository contains a collection of projects built with React.js. These projects showcase various concepts, including state management, component-based architecture, routing, and API integration. Each project demonstrates my learning and experience with React.js, from simple applications to more complex, feature-rich projects.

Technologies Used:
**React**
**JSX**
**CSS/SCSS**
**React Router**
**Fetch (for API requests)**
**State Management (useState, useContext, Redux, etc.)**

Feel free to fork this repository and submit pull requests if you have suggestions or improvements for any of the projects.
